# History

## v3.0.0 August 27, 2015
- Added new `class` type that the `getType` method can now return
- Added the methods:
 	- `isClass` (checks for native and conventional classes)
	- `isNativeClass` (checks for native ES6 classes)
	- `isConventionalClass` (checks for functions that start with a capital letter)
- Anonymous compiled/non-native classes may be detected as functions instead of as classes. If you rely on class detection, be aware of this, and document this to your users accordingly.
